Certainly! Here's a simple project idea for a .NET WPF application: A Personal Expense Tracker. This project is great for practicing data binding, user input handling, and basic UI design in WPF. It will also introduce you to working with lists and basic data storage.
Project Overview: Personal Expense Tracker

Objective: Create an application where users can add, view, and track their daily expenses.
Features:

    Add Expenses: Users can input the amount, category (like groceries, utilities, etc.), and date of the expense.

    View Expenses: Display a list of all recorded expenses.

    Calculate Total: Show the total amount spent, either overall or filtered by category.

Step-by-Step Guide:

    Setup the Project:
        Create a new WPF App (.NET Core) project in Visual Studio.
        Name the project "ExpenseTracker".

    Design the UI:
        Open MainWindow.xaml.
        Use Grid or StackPanel to layout your UI.
        Add TextBox controls for input (amount, category, date).
        Add a Button for adding expenses.
        Include a ListBox or DataGrid for displaying expenses.
        Optionally, add TextBlocks or Labels to display the total expense.

    Create the Data Model:
        Define a class named Expense with properties like Amount, Category, and Date.

    csharp

    public class Expense
    {
        public double Amount { get; set; }
        public string Category { get; set; }
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    }

    Implement Data Binding:
        In your MainWindow.xaml.cs, create an ObservableCollection of Expense that will be used to store the expenses.
        Bind this collection to your ListBox or DataGrid.

    Handle User Input:
        Implement the logic to add a new Expense to the collection when the user clicks the add button.

    Calculate and Display Totals:
        Implement functionality to calculate the total expense. You can do this every time a new expense is added.

    Polish the UI:
        Style your application to make it user-friendly.

    Testing:
        Run your application and test all functionalities.

Optional Enhancements:

    Add functionality to edit or delete expenses.
    Implement data persistence to save expenses (e.g., using a local database or a file).
    Add filtering options to view expenses by category or date range.
    Implement data validation to ensure correct input formats.
